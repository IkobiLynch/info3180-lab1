    <h1>Ikobi Lynch</h1>
    <p>I am a final year student at The University of the West Indies. I aspire to own my own tech company in the near future, 
        so I am trying to have as broad of a knowledge as I can have about various technical topics. I will get it done, and I
        will be succesful. Thank you for attending my Ted talk.
